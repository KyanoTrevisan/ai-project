    "## Encountered Problems and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "During the development of the scripts, particularly those involving OpenCV for game steering, we encountered a few challenges. Here's an overview of these issues and the solutions we implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Difficulty with Timing in OpenCV Script\n",
    "- **Problem**: One of the main difficulties was related to the timing of key inputs. Since we were using a keyboard for inputs instead of a controller, we couldn't input driving angles directly. This limitation made it challenging to precisely control the steering in the game.\n",
    "- **Solution**: We adjusted the script to better handle the timing of key presses. This involved fine-tuning the duration for which each key was held down and the intervals between key presses. By experimenting with these timings, we were able to achieve more nuanced control, even with the binary nature of keyboard inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Issue with pyautogui in TrackMania\n",
    "- **Problem**: Initially, we tried using `pyautogui` for simulating keyboard inputs. However, we found that `pyautogui` was not effective in the context of the game TrackMania.\n",
    "- **Solution**: After some research and testing, we switched to `pydirectinput`. This library is specifically designed for direct input in games and works well with games like TrackMania. `PyDirectInput` provided more reliable and consistent input simulation compared to `pyautogui`, which solved the issue we were facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Tips for Similar Projects\n",
    "- **Experiment with Timing**: Timing of key presses is crucial, especially when simulating analog input (like steering angles) with digital means (like keyboard presses). It often requires trial and error to get it right.\n",
    "- **Choose the Right Library for Input Simulation**: Not all libraries work the same in every context, especially in gaming environments. If one library doesn’t work (like `pyautogui` in our case), try others (like `pydirectinput`).\n",
    "- **Document Adjustments**: Keep track of the adjustments you make, especially when fine-tuning timings or switching libraries. This documentation can be invaluable for troubleshooting and future development."

    "## Detailed Script Descriptions\n",
    "Each script in our project serves a specific purpose in the AI model's development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **open_cv.py**: This script utilizes OpenCV for processing screen captures from the game. It detects lane lines and calculates the driving angle and speed, essential for understanding the car's position and movement on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **gather_play_data.py**: It focuses on collecting gameplay data. This script captures screen data while driving the car manually and logs corresponding control actions. This data forms the basis for training the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **create_model.py**: This script is responsible for constructing and training the deep learning model. It includes steps for loading data, preprocessing, setting up the neural network architecture, and training the model with data augmentation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **use_model.py**: The final script uses the trained model to automate gameplay. It makes real-time decisions for controlling the car in the game, effectively replacing manual input with AI-driven responses."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook encapsulates a journey through automating game control using a combination of technologies like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyDirectInput. We navigated various challenges, from image processing and machine learning model training to real-time game interaction and key press simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: This project illustrates the power of integrating different fields—computer vision, machine learning, and game automation. It shows how they can come together to create an innovative solution.\n",
    "2. **Problem-Solving and Adaptability**: We encountered and overcame several challenges. Adjusting the timing of simulated key inputs and switching to a more suitable library for game control are testaments to the importance of problem-solving and adaptability in software development.\n",
    "3. **Practical Applications of AI**: The project offers a glimpse into the practical applications of AI and machine learning. It demonstrates how AI can interact with and control other software systems (like video games) in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "This project is not just about automating a game; We learned about what can be achieved when we bridge the gap between AI and real-world applications. It's a stepping stone towards more complex and nuanced AI interactions in various domains. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible, the learnings from such projects will be invaluable."
